Synagri Project Bioeconomy Model

The transition to a bioeconomy in the Norwegian dairy sector presents both opportunities and risks, shaped by farm size, location and dependence on subsidies. This analysis employs a hybrid modelling approach, combining Agent-Based Modelling and System Dynamics to simulate the transition of Norwegian dairy farms towards a bioeconomy. Hybrid modelling allows us to capture both the micro-level behaviours of individual farms and the macro-level dynamics of the agricultural system (Brailsford et al.,2019).
Agent-Based Modelling is used to represent individual farms as autonomous agents with distinct characteristics—such as size, location, and subsidy levels (Helbing, 2012). These agents make decisions based on internal rules and external stimuli, such as market signals or policy changes. ABM is particularly useful for capturing heterogeneity and emergent behaviours, such as clustering or tipping points.
In this case study we use the NO Protein Agent‑Based Model v1.0 (Roxburgh, Polhill, Burton, & Mittenzwei, 2023) to simulate the Norwegian agri‑food sector. The NO Protein Agent‑Based Model was developed to explore the possible effects of cultivated protein on the Norwegian agri food sector. It uses agents to represent the main parts of the value chain, including farms, dairies, slaughterhouses, import and export checkpoints, retailers, and consumers. The model simulates all of Norway’s roughly 42,000 farms from 2013 onwards, with cultivated protein production introduced from 2025 once it becomes cost competitive. Scenarios from Vergeer et al. (2021) are applied, and the runs continue until 2050. Farms stop operating if their revenue falls below a set threshold, while dairies and slaughterhouses close if the supply of raw products from farms drops below their own threshold. In addition, farms cease dairy activities if there are no dairies within a given radius, and they stop livestock rearing if there are no slaughterhouses nearby. Consumers are modelled to buy from the cheapest available source, though the market share of each cultivated protein product is capped at 53.9%.
System Dynamics, on the other hand, models the broader system-level feedback loops, such as supply chain interactions, policy impacts, and market evolution (Sterman, 2000; Richardson 1991). System Dynamics helps in understanding long-term trends and cumulative effects, such as the decline in farm numbers or shifts in production efficiency.
The System Dynamics model is designed to capture representative behaviours at the farm level that influence a farmer’s decision to either continue operating or to cease operations. These mechanisms are illustrated in the causal loop diagram in Figure 4, which provides a visual overview of the core feedback within the system.
For analytical clarity, these dynamics are established at the municipality level. Within each municipality, dairy farms are aggregated into their respective clusters, ensuring that the simulation reflects localised patterns and group behaviours. This clustering approach enables the model to assess the collective impact of regional factors on farm viability.
The model calculates key financial indicators for every farm. These indicators are used to adjust the probability that an individual farm will discontinue operations at the conclusion of each year. This probabilistic assessment is responsive to annual changes in economic conditions, policy interventions, and market developments, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of farm-level decision-making within the broader system.
The probability that an individual farm will cease operations is fed back into the NO Protein Agent-Based Model. This feedback mechanism enables the model to dynamically recalculate changes in price, demand, supply, and supply chain dynamics across the entire system. By integrating Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) with System Dynamics, the approach facilitates a two-way interaction: decisions made at the farm level are aggregated to produce systemic outcomes, while broader system-level changes subsequently influence the behaviour of individual farms.
This dual-modelling perspective is crucial for analysing the complex transitions associated with the move towards a bioeconomy. It ensures that both micro-level and macro-level processes are captured, providing a comprehensive understanding of how individual decisions and collective trends interact during periods of significant change.
2.3 Scenarios Used in the Analysis
The analysis explores four scenarios based on previous research on bioeconomy transitions (e.g., Wydra et al., 2021; Fritsche et al., 2021):
•	Business as Usual (BaU): This baseline scenario assumes no significant bioeconomic transition. Trends continue as they have, with gradual declines in farm numbers and limited innovation.
•	Scenario 1 – Optimisation: This scenario assumes that the transition to the bioeconomy primarily results in efficiency gains. Farms adopt new technologies that reduce costs and increase throughput without fundamentally changing the nature of production. The focus is on productivity and cost-effectiveness.
•	Scenario 2 – Side Streams: Here, the bioeconomy creates opportunities for new revenue streams by repurposing biological by-products. Examples include converting whey into bioplastics or manure into bioenergy. This scenario emphasises diversification and circularity.
•	Scenario 3 – Transformation: This scenario envisions a radical shift where synthetic biology and bioreactors produce cultivated dairy and meat products that compete directly with traditional farming. It represents a disruptive transformation of the value chain, potentially reducing the demand for conventional farms.
